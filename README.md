Yasoob's Soundcloud Downloader:
===============================
This is a simple soundcloud searcher and downloader i wrote in python. 
It requires the requests library .The script is well documented and
will help a new python programmer to understand it as well.
I hope that you guys like my work. As a token of appreciation you can star this project.
It is inspired by https://github.com/jacktheripper51/groove-dl

###Syntax:
```CLI: soundcloud-dl.py```

###Dependencies:
* Python 2.6
* Requests library (I will try to remove this dependency.)
  
###Authors:
* M.Yasoob

###Disclaimer:
I'm not responsible for any violations this script does to Soundcloud's TOS. It's more of a
proof of concept.
