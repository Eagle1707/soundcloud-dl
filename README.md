== Soundcloud-dl

This is a simple soundcloud searcher and downloader i wrote in python. It requires the requests library and uses wget for downloading the songs. The script is well documented and will help a new python programmer to understand it as well. I hope that you guys like my work. As a token of appreciation you can star this project.
