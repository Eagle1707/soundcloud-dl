Yasoob's Soundcloud Downloader:
===============================
This is a simple soundcloud searcher and downloader i wrote in python. 
It requires the requests library .The script is well documented and
will help a new python programmer to understand it as well.
I hope that you guys like my work. As a token of appreciation you can star this project.
It is inspired by https://github.com/jacktheripper51/groove-dl . I have made this script because 
I was not able to find a good python script for downloading songs from soundcloud. If you want 
to contribute then just clone this repo and submit a pull request. I will review your pull 
request and then i will merge it.

### Syntax:

```CLI: soundcloud_dl.py```

### Dependencies:

* Python 2.6
* Requests library 

### Tests:

I have included a test which will only run if you have pytest installed. Currently I am testing only a single function. With time i will add tests for other functions as well. If you don't have pytest installed then you can install it by typing ```pip install pytest``` or ```easy_install pytest```.

### Authors:

* M.Yasoob

### Disclaimer:

I'm not responsible for any violations this script does to Soundcloud's TOS. It's more of a
proof of concept.

### TODO:

* Add a nice GUI with PyQt, PySide or wxPython. If you want to contribute then I think this is the best thing to contribute.
* Use argparse module for getting the input
* Do some code refractory so that it uses the best practices.
